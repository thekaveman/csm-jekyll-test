The landmark Santa Monica Civic Auditorium opened in 1958 as a public gathering place for cultural, educational, and community events. Designed by noted architect Welton Beckett, the classic Streamline Moderne building is as the architectural focal point for the southern sector of Santa Monica's Civic Center.

Regular operation of the Civic Auditorium was suspended in June 2013, due to the loss of redevelopment funds needed to rehabilitate the facility. Now in an interim use phase, the Civic is available for limited event and filming rental. [More information on facility rental](/rent/)

A community process to plan for the future of the Civic Auditorium is now underway, led by a City Council-appointed working group. [More information on the planning process](/planning/)

The Civic Auditorium is managed by the City of Santa Monica Cultural Affairs Division of the Community & Cultural Services Department.
